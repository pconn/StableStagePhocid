Welcome to the github repository associated with the paper, "Modeling vital rates and age-sex structure of Pacific arctic phocids: influence on aerial survey correction factors" by Conn and Trukhanova.  

Recreating analyses in this paper is relatively straightforward, as one only needs to run the 
script "run_analysis.R" which is located in the StableStagePhocid/inst directory. The underlying
data on haul-out predictions and life history schedules are provided in the StableStagePhocid/data directory.  The user will likely need to edit relative paths in 
the "run_analysis.R" but that will likely be the only change that will need to be made.
